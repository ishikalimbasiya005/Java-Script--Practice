# 🧠 JavaScript Event Handling Examples

This project contains **multiple HTML files** demonstrating how JavaScript handles different types of events like `click`, event propagation (bubbling/capturing), and `preventDefault()` behavior using a set of God images.

## 📁 Files Included

1. **onclick-event.html**  
   - Basic `click` event listener on an image.
   - Alerts a message when Hanuman Ji image is clicked.
   - Demonstrates properties of the event object like `type`, `target`, `clientX`, `ctrlKey`, etc.

2. **event-bubbling-capturing.html**  
   - Demonstrates **event bubbling** and **event capturing**.
   - Uses `stopPropagation()` to stop bubbling.
   - Uses `preventDefault()` to stop the anchor tag from navigating to another page.

3. **event-bubbling-capturing-again.html**  
   - Duplicate of file 2 for practice or extended testing of bubbling/capturing.
   - Also uses `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`.

4. **remove-image-on-click.html**  
   - Images are removed when clicked.
   - Shows the removed image’s ID below the gallery using DOM manipulation.

## 🔧 Features Demonstrated

- ✅ `addEventListener()` with `click`
- ✅ `event.stopPropagation()` for controlling bubbling
- ✅ `event.preventDefault()` to stop default link behavior
- ✅ DOM manipulation using `.remove()` and `.innerHTML`
- ✅ Accessing event object properties: `target`, `currentTarget`, `type`, `clientX`, etc.
