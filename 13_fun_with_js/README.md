# ðŸŽ¯ Fun with JavaScript â€“ Lexical Scope, Closures & Color Changer

This project demonstrates key JavaScript concepts through simple interactive examples.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

### âœ… Lexical Scope
- A function can access variables defined in its outer scope.

### âœ… Closures
- Functions returned from other functions remember their lexical environment, even after the outer function has finished executing.

### âœ… Event Handling with Closure
- Dynamically change the background color of the page using buttons.
- `clickHandler()` returns a closure that retains access to the `color` variable.

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Features

- Three buttons: Orange, Pink, and Green
- Clicking a button changes the page background color using closure-based handlers
