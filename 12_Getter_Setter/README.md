# 🔐 JavaScript Getters and Setters Demo

This project explains how to use `get` and `set` to manage object properties in JavaScript using classes, constructor functions, and object literals.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### ✅ Class with Getters and Setters
Defines `get` and `set` methods inside a class to control access and format of properties like `email` and `password`.

### ✅ Constructor Function with Object.defineProperty
Uses `Object.defineProperty()` to manually define getters and setters for properties, providing controlled access and formatting.

### ✅ Object Literal with Getters and Setters
Uses getter and setter methods directly inside an object, and accesses them using `Object.create()` to inherit behavior.

## 💡 Key Concepts

- `get`: Allows you to return formatted or computed values.
- `set`: Allows you to control how values are assigned.
- `Object.defineProperty()`: Enables advanced property configuration like `writable`, `enumerable`, and `configurable`.
- Encapsulation: Hides internal variables and exposes controlled interfaces.
