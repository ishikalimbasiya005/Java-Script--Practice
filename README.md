## 📺 YouTube Learning Source

I’ve learned and practiced most of the JavaScript concepts in this repository by following the **Chai aur Code** YouTube channel, created by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/@chaiaurcode).  
Huge thanks to him for the clear and beginner-friendly explanations that made learning JavaScript fun and effective! 🙏☕

## 🏫 Classroom Learning Source

Some of the JavaScript concepts were also learned in my classes at **Skywin IT Academy, Surat**.  
Grateful to the mentors and instructors for their support, practical teaching approach, and real-world examples that helped build a strong foundation. 🎓🙏

## 🧪 How to Use

Explore each folder and open the `.js` or `.html` files in your code editor or browser console to try out the code. You can test and tweak the code to understand how it works.
